# SOLID Principles in C#
This project, originally created in Farsi as a solution file for a course, focuses on the five fundamental principles of SOLID, a set of principles for writing maintainable and scalable software in C# and other object-oriented languages. The SOLID principles provide a blueprint to design software that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

# Features
- Understanding SOLID Principles: Grasp the essential SOLID principles, including Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open/Closed Principle (OCP), Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
- Practical Implementation in C#: Explore practical implementations of these principles using C#, demonstrating how to design flexible, maintainable, and robust software applications.
- Course Solution in Farsi: Utilize the provided course solution file in Farsi, catering to Persian-speaking audiences and making the learning experience more effective.
